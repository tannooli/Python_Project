        <h2>MaskFormer</h2>
        <p>MaskFormer model trained on ADE20k semantic segmentation (large-sized version, Swin backbone). It was
            introduced in the paper Per-Pixel Classification is Not All You Need for Semantic Segmentation and first
            released in this repository.
            Disclaimer: The team releasing MaskFormer did not write a model card for this model so this model card has
            been written by the Hugging Face team.</p>
        <h2>Model description</h2>
        <p>MaskFormer addresses instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation with the same paradigm: by predicting a set
            of masks and corresponding labels. Hence, all 3 tasks are treated as if they were instance segmentation.</p>
