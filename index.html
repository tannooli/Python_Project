        <h3>MaskFormer</h3>
        <p class="lead">MaskFormer model trained on ADE20k semantic segmentation (large-sized version, Swin backbone). <br>It was
            introduced in the paper Per-Pixel Classification is Not All You Need for Semantic Segmentation and first
            released in this repository.</p>
        <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: The team releasing MaskFormer did not write a model card for this model so this model card
            has been written by the Hugging Face team.</p>
        <h3>Model description</h3>
        <p>MaskFormer addresses instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation with the same paradigm: by predicting a set
            of masks and corresponding labels. Hence, all 3 tasks are treated as if they were instance segmentation.</p>

        <h2>Intended uses & limitations</h2>
        <p>You can use this particular checkpoint for semantic segmentation. See the model hub to look for other
            fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.</p>
