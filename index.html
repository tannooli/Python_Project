        <h2>MaskFormer</h2>
        <p>MaskFormer model trained on ADE20k semantic segmentation (large-sized version, Swin backbone). <br>It was introduced in the paper Per-Pixel Classification is Not All You Need for Semantic Segmentation and first released in this repository.</p>
            <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: The team releasing MaskFormer did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.</p>
        <h2>Model description</h2>
        <p>MaskFormer addresses instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation with the same paradigm: by predicting a set of masks and corresponding labels. Hence, all 3 tasks are treated as if they were instance segmentation.</p>

        <h2>Intended uses & limitations</h2>
        <p>You can use this particular checkpoint for semantic segmentation. See the model hub to look for other fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.</p>
